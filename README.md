# Java Chess GUI

A simple Chess GUI written in Java. Extremely weak!

## How to Run

To run this GUI locally on your computer you simply need to run the [AlphaBetaChess.java file](https://github.com/TheYoBots/Java-Chess-GUI/blob/master/AlphaBetaChess.java). There are still a few errors in this code so it might fail, so please forgive me for that.

## Contributing

Honestly this repository is not Actively maintained by me, but incase you have a change, do send in a Pull Request and I'd be really grateful! Just make sure to follow a common open source contribution etiquette.
